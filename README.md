# Grid_Strategy
This game developed using SFML library in C++

Not completed yet so that's why this repository looks like a trash. For now this files enough for testing I think. Actually I should search which files should I import to github in C++ projects. There is too much things to I can import .exe or .vcpkoj files etc. You can reach me if u would like to inform or teach me about this topics. I'm new in C++. Thanks <3
